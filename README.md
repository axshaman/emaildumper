MANUAL INSTALL

2. Setting up a Virtual Environment
```sh
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --user tqdm
```

3. Installing Additional Dependencies (if required)
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install p7zip-full -y
```
4. Editing `config.ini`
The `config.ini` file stores IMAP server details and the email retrieval period.

- If both `start_date` and `end_date` are empty, it fetches all emails.  
- If only one date is provided, it fetches emails up to or from that date.  

#Example `config.ini`
```
[IMAP]
server = imap.gmail.com
login = your_email@gmail.com
password = your_password
start_date = 01-Jan-2024
end_date = 02-Feb-2024
```

5. Running the Script
#Using `config.ini` settings
```sh
python fetch_and_archive.py
```

#Manually entering IMAP settings
If `--manual` is passed, the script will prompt the user to enter server, login, password, and date range manually.
```sh
python fetch_and_archive.py --manual
```
